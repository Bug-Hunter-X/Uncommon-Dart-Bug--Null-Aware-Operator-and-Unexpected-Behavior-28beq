# Uncommon Dart Bug: Null-Aware Operator and Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Dart related to the null-aware operator (`??`) when used with nullable types and getter/setter methods.

The `bug.dart` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The issue arises from unexpected behavior when a nullable value is passed to the setter and subsequently accessed via the getter. The null-aware operator is used to provide a default value, but this default value might not be intuitive in all situations.

## Solution

The solution involves a careful review of how null values are handled and potentially adjusting the logic to ensure consistent behavior. The provided solution explains and demonstrates the fix.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart`.
3. Observe the output.  The output demonstrates unexpected behavior.
4. Run `bugSolution.dart`. Observe the corrected behavior.
